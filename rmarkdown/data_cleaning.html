<p>Using the <code>qualtRics</code> package the surveys were pulled directly from Qualtrics. In order to connect to the Qualtrics API, you must have UT staff privileges. Any UT student must have their privileges updated by contacting UT IT Services. Your Qualtrics API can be accessed through account settings in the “Qualtrics IDs” section.</p>

<p>The main challenge with data cleaning is compiling the responses from the survey that are separated out over multiple columns. In order to make things more comprehensible, I’m going to break up the data set into thematic areas based on the sections. Each of these data sets will have a response id and organization name, so they can be recombined at the end to make comparison and create specialized data sets.</p>
