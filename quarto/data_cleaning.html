<p>The main challenge with data cleaning is compiling the responses from the survey that are separated out over multiple columns. In order to make things more comprehensible, the data set is broken up into thematic areas. Each of these will have a response id and organization name, so they can be recombined at the end to make comparison and create specialized data sets.</p>
